# IMPORTANT NOTICES


## 1. HEALTH AND WELLNESS

-   Covid-19 and other respiratory viruses are continuing to evolve and
    infection and hospitalization rates continue to show depressing
    cycles of surge and fall, at both a local and national level&#x2013;long
    beyond what was hoped four years ago.

-   To reduce the risk of infection and increase the possibility of
    wellness allowing us to focus on learning and working together,
    please be monitor your health and be mindful of others around
    you. You are always welcome to wear a mask in class for whatever
    reason and the professor will frequently do so.

-   This is a request for us to think socially about how our choices
    impact others and how we can maximize learning opportunities.
    **Please respect each other's choices on this issue**.


## 2. ATTENDANCE, ZOOM AND CLASS RECORDINGS

-   **ZOOM AND CLASS ATTENDANCE WHEN UNWELL** - If you feel sick or are
    showing symptoms of Covid-19, flu or cold then **PLEASE BE
    CONSIDERATE** of your classmates and attend the class remotely
    through Zoom. All class sessions will be available live through Zoom
    (see links in Canvas) and as recordings.

-   Please make use of ****absence notices**** in `Path@Penn` to inform the
    professor if you need to miss class due to extenuating
    circumstances. Submitting an absence notice does not excuse students
    from their course obligations. But you can view missed class session
    in class recordings in Canvas.

# Course Description, Goals and Objectives

In this hands-on course students will learn how to manage large textual
datasets (e.g. social media, news stories, song lyrics, YouTube comments) to
investigate research questions. They will work through a series of steps
to *collect*, *organize*, *analyze* and *present* textual data by using
basic Python coding toward a final project of relevant interest. The
course will cover linguistic theory and techniques that can be applied
to textual data (particularly from the fields of corpus linguistics and
natural language processing, including recent advances from LLMs).

***No prior programming experience is required.*** Through this course
students will gain skills writing Python programs to handle large
amounts of textual data and become familiar with one of the key
techniques used by data scientists, which is currently one of the most
in-demand jobs.

-   This course will provide an introduction to Python programming for
    collecting, preparing and analyzing text data from various sources
    including social media (e.g. Twitter), weblogs, online news media and
    various publicly available archives (e.g. presidential speech archive,
    congressional sessions).

-   Each week one session will be in lecture and seminar form and provide
    background for the theory and techniques and the second will be a lab
    session in which students will work through programming exercises
    using Jupyter notebooks [A web-based programming environment well
    suited for data science and class-based assignments].

-   By completing this course students will:
    -   gain an understanding of relevant linguistic concepts for the
        analysis of text
    -   understand the field of corpus linguistics and how its concepts and
        tools can be applied to text analysis questions of relevance to
        Communication
    -   be exposed to a range of techniques from natural language processing
        and understand how they can be used to improve content analyses
    -   gain a basic level of programming proficiency in the Python
        programming language and have completed a number of programming
        exercises to build, clean and analysis corpora of text
    -   complete a data science project focused the analysis of text data
        and gain group work and collaborative skills

# Assessment

1.  **Complete the assigned readings and corpus building exercises (10%)**
    -   Readings for each week will be posted on Canvas when electronic
        versions are available or taken from one of the recommended
        textbooks.
    -   Throughout the course you will be asked to complete short writing
        exercises that will be used to build a class corpus for analysis.
        Details will be discussed in class and posted on Canvas.
        -   Examples of the prompts might be:
            -   *Describe your interest in Communication research.*
            -   *Look at this picture closely for a minute and then write a
                paragraph describing what you see.*
            -   *Write about your earliest memory.*
            -   *Create a recipe for a fried or boiled egg for your room mate
                who doesn't know how to cook.*

2.  **Attend weekly lab sessions and complete the assigned exercises
    (40%)**
    -   Thursday class sessions will *usually* be programming labs.
        Students are required to bring a laptop. Please contact the me if
        this is difficult and we can see if a machine can be made available
        for use in lab.
    -   We will be using Jupyter notebooks to learn Python, which are a
        web-based interactive programming environment. You will need a
        `github` account (<https://education.github.com/>) to access the
        class server. Assignments will be completed in this and submitted
        to the instructor. Details of using this system for assignments
        will be covered in the first lab session.
    -   Weekly assignments will be due at 5pm on the Tuesday following lab
        session (see schedule for details). These assignments are intended
        to help students practice the programming concepts and structures
        introduced in lab and build confidence. They should not be
        difficult or take excessive time but they do build from week to
        week so it is *very* important to keep up.

3.  **Complete a *group project* that uses the techniques and theory
    covered in class to carry out a text analysis of a specific research
    question agreed upon with the instructor (50%)**
    -   The goal of the project is to practice the coding skills and
        analytic techniques learned in the class by carrying out a focused
        data science project. The steps involved will include:
        1.  Select a tractable research question that involves analysis of
            textual data
        2.  Identify, retrieve and prepare a relevant corpus
        3.  Carry out linguistic analysis of corpus and produce a series
            of well documented analysis notebooks
        4.  Visualize the data and findings
        5.  Interpret the findings 6, Finally, produce a data blog post
            (similar to those on medium.com) to communicate your findings
    
    -   You will work in a group of 2 to 4 people
    
    -   You can build your own group with those you know in the class and
        you share an interest for a particular research topic. (We can
        also help form groups of people with similar interests).
    
    -   More details of the kinds of projects that would be appropriate and
        manageable will be discussed during the first few weeks of class.


# Note about learning programming

-   A central goal of this class is to help students begin to develop

programming skills that they can use to approach questions of interest
using the growing amounts of textual data available in the era of 'big
data'. But like learning any new skill, such as a new language, it takes
time and can be frustrating at first. This course does not require
students to have any programming background. Realistically it is not
possible to become a fully proficient programmer in just one semester.
However, the lab sessions and assignments are focused on helping you
begin this process and to become comfortable with reading, understanding
and modifying Python code examples that you can find on the web etc.

-   **Using generative AI tools** - We will talk more about the potential
    benefits and drawbacks of using generative AI tools such as ChatGPT
    and Copilot to learn programming as the course progresses. There is
    neither a blanket prohibition or full encouragement for the use of
    these developing tools in this course. I will provide more guidance
    as we go along.
